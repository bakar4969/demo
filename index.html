Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal. He was a Muhajir of Urdu-speaking origin.[16][17][1][5][18] He claimed maternal Yusufzai lineage from Tirah Valley while from his paternal side, his ancestor was an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad of Ghor, the 12th century conqueror; this ancestral reason inspired Khan to later name a ballistic missile the Ghauri.[19] In 1994-1995, Khan would have a mausoleum built over Ghori's grave situated in Dhamiak village around 80 kilometres from Islamabad.[20] He stated at a 2014 event marking the launch of the book Rajgan-e-Mewat by Professor Khanzada Amanullah Nausherwi[21] that he was of Khanzada Rajput descent, asserting that his father, Abdul Ghafoor Khan Khanzada, belonged to a Jadubansi Rajput lineage and had adopted the title “Khan” due to fear of discrimination.[22]

His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very religious mindset.[23] His older siblings, along with other family members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, who would often write to Khan's parents about the new life they had found in Pakistan.[24]

After his matriculation from a local school in Bhopal, in 1952 Khan emigrated from India to Pakistan on the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation politics[25]: 254  at that time, and religious violence in India during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world view.[26] Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly attended the D. J. Science College before transferring to the University of Karachi, where he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration on solid-state physics.[27][28]

From 1956 to 1959, Khan was employed by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (city government) as an inspector of weights and measures. During this time, he applied for a scholarship that allowed him to study in West Germany.[29][30] In 1961, Khan departed for West Germany to study material science at the Technical University in West Berlin, where he academically excelled in courses in metallurgy, but left West Berlin when he switched to the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1965.[24]
